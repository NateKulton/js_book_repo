I did problem one in a differenet dir, so that is why 2 is the first one you see now.

Problem 2:

I was confused as to how to multiply the numbers. I didn't know if I needed to do it in the for
condition or not. But I did know that I needed to decrement the numbers to start

Problem 3:

For starters counter was reassgined in the conditional statement, which is bad practice for one.
Second, I'd guess it is because the stopping condition was put in a different block so it doesn't do anything.
Interesting is was because the return value of the reassginned (counter = 1) evalutes to a truthy value so it just keeps outputting the code because the stopping condition is too high.

Problem 4:

My answer: It will throw an error because you can't increment the number in a console.log
Interesting I guees you can still do it that way because it is still within the function's body.
I also learned that if I incremented the normal way it would have been a different output too


Problem 5:

I didn't really have any notes on this, besides the ones I made in .js form

Problem 6:

So it was not getting it. So I watched the video
