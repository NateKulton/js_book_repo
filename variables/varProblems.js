// Problem 3:

/*
Guessed it'd give a error
it thing the error is 'not defined' 'something something'
*/

// So we get "ReferenceError: foo is not defined" so I pretty must had it

// Problem 4:

/*
The Victor part of the code will run then
the program will stop because you can't
reassign a const variable
(I knew it would throw an error. I should have said that in my og answer)
*/

// so the error is: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// Problem 5:

// my answer 'qux'
// I didn't see that they declared a new variable instead of reassigning the og one

// Problem 6:

// No because one has block scope and the other has global scope
// So it looks like my answer was mostly right. Maybe not as detailed but I'd say it passed
