Problem 1:
my answers: array1: 1, array2: 5, array3: 1 (right answer 0), array4: 3, array5: 1 (right answer 101)

Problem 2:

I knew I needed to use the % operator but I forgot how to write the code properly

Problem 3:

my answer had the same output but is was less clean (I can't rememeber the actually term)

Problem 4:

So my answer was almost the same except I didn't use return statements,
 and I used my console.log in the functiion instead. All in all, I'd say I was on track with this one

Problem 5:

I took my time on this one but I did it so well! The big differnce between mine the LS. School one
is that I used a if when I could have just used the return statement without it because Number.isInteger
returns a boolean value so if I just used that in the return statement it would have been like a ternary operator

Problem 6:

at one point I did make a function that gave me the answer but it didn't have both .map and .filter in it.
Also this lesson was misleading when they say I have to use both of those but then never said a word about .length tbh
I thought it was cheating to use it because they never said a word about it.
So I tried this again and I think I found out the problem, I was using the not operator on the whole function
so it never ran the code because it turned the function into a falsy value

Problem 7:

So I got the problem right... At least the output that is. I didn't use a single function, I used two of them.
Plus I used the .forEach as well and the .reduce method in my code.
I understand the big differnce between the two answers. I made a new array with the new value that
I made from the og array, but they made a function that iterates over the array, and then they passed the array as
an argument to the function in the console.log so it outputs the resolute of that code

Problem 8:

This was a very complicated problem so I was a little confused with it

Problem 9:

I was trying to make all this crazy code and it was just a simple method, oof

Problem 10:

This one was super easy! I just used the idex of the nested array then the index of the target element
